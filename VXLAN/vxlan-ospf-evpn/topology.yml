    VXLAN with OSPF, iBGP and EVPN running on five Arista nodes:
    * distribution nodes v1xsw01 and v1xsw02 have both two connection to each of
      the access nodes v1xsw03-05
    Linux Servers are connected as access endpoints in their particular VLANs
    * red1 <> v1xsw03
    * red2 <> v1xsw05
    * blue1 <> v1xsw03
    * blue2 <> v1xsw04 are endpoints in each vrf
    VRF `tenant` is shared for both VLANs
