## DMVPN lab topology
In this lab topology a situation is simulated where an IPsec interconnect to a 4G IoT provider is used to connect 4G enabled spoke routers to local hub routers and configure a DMVPN overlay over which anything can be routed.

![DMVPN topology](dmvpn.png)

Some notes:
- The IoT provider / underlay network is configured with static routes.
- The uplink to the IoT provider is an IPsec tunnel.
- An ACL prevents direct traffic between spokes over the 4G underlay, simulating the properties of a 4G network.
- In the lab a routed IPsec tunnel is used whereas a provider would typically use a policy based IPsec tunnel. 
- `10.0.1.0/29` is used for the hub interconnects and as such is part of both the underlay as well as the overlay network. 
- To counter recursive routing the spokes are configured with a specific static route for the /29 subnet.
- IPsec encryption of the GRE tunnels can be added by adding the IPsec policy and transform set etc. as well as the `tunnel protection IPsec profile <ipsec profile>` statement on the tunnel interfaces, with the additional keyword `shared` added to the spoke tunnel interfaces.
- An OSPF cost statement on the hub2 tunnel1 interface turns the hubs into an active/standby setup (`ip ospf cost 2000`).
