# IBGP-Only Network Design

This directory contains the lab topology described in the [IBGP Is the Better EBGP](https://blog.ipspace.net/2025/01/ibgp-better-ebgp/) blog post.

The topology relies on a plugin that restructures the IBGP sessions and a custom configuration for FRRouting and Arista EOS that enforces the change of BGP next hops of reflected routes. 

Please submit a Pull Request if you have successfully implemented the same functionality on other platforms.
